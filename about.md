## Academic Background:

* Completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Mumbai University
* Completed my Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University

My message to those of you who are still at University working towards a degree is to cherish the moment of being in school because I think it is the best time of your life. A lot of students are too keen on getting out of school and start earning thinking that 'I will enjoy everything when I start to learn', I still had the same feeling but I also realized that I am not going to get this time back, ever. Recently came across a very good saying from one of my colleagues, "Tomorrow will worry about itself."

## Professional Background:

* First gig into the Software World was with Massively Parallel Technologies where I worked while I was in school at Arizona State University. 
* Have been working as a Software Engineer for Orion Health since I graduated from ASU
